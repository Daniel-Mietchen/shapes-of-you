## Fails loading files to `rdflib`

**Indexing topics**: `ncats+translator`, `biothings`, `smartapi`, `knowledge+provider`

*Please check if your RDF file is properly formatted. We recommend to **use https://www.easyrdf.org/converter to get better insights on the error**, and store the shapes in `.ttl` files*
