## Fails loading files to `rdflib`

**Indexing topics**: `r2rml`, `rml`, `topic:rml-mapping`, `nanobench`, `nanopub`

*Please check if your RDF file is properly formatted. We recommend to **use https://www.easyrdf.org/converter to get better insights on the error**, and store the shapes in `.ttl` files*
