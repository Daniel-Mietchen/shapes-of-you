Prefilled text is provided as information, feel free to delete it before submitting the issue, to just keep the titles.

#### Describe the improvement

Clearly describe the improvement related to indexing you propose, usually about indexing new standards or retrieving more metadata when parsing files or SPARQL endpoints

#### Relevant links

Add here any information that could help us implement the indexation of a new resource, for example if applicable:
* The URI of the class usually used to define the `rdf:type` of this resource
* The URI of relevant properties to retrieve metadata about this resource
* Pointers to libraries, or documentation, to parse new metadata or a new standard


#### Corresponding schema.org concept

If you propose to index new metadata or files, please provide the URI (identifier) of a class which can be used to describe the new concept or property in our knowledge graph. Use schema.org if possible, but you are free to use any other relevant ontology
